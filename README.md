# Multi-Class Classification: Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

## Overview
The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to focus on optimizating Deep Neural Networks. It includes the implementation of a multi-layer feed-forward neural network that is designed for dealing with multi-class classification tasks.

## Features
- Implementation of a feed-forward neural network.
- Techniques for optimizing neural network performance.
- Visualization of training results and model metrics.

## Usage
Run each cell sequentially to see the model implementation and results.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`

## Input
The notebook expects datasets that are suitable for multi-class classification. Ensure all data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets before use.

## Output
- Visualizations of the training process.
- Performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running to avoid runtime errors.
- This notebook requires modifications for production use.
